REFLECTION
You may have observed last week that the API specification we gave for you to follow (i.e., the shape of incoming requests and outgoing responses) was not great for extensibility. There are, indeed, many things that could be improved. Name two.

1. The fact the we use Object in the Map<String, Object> type of all responses made us rely on type casting when sending out the BroadBandHandler response. This lack of specification, caused us to hardcode the casting ((String) map.get("response")) which may not be extensible to other scenarios or if the API structure changes.
2. The query parameter structure works for this instance where we are taking in a max of 3 parameters. But, what if we need to feed the API a lot more than just 3 parameters, a parameter that is weirdly formatted, or a parameter that isn’t just a string key. This may cause issues to arise

Hint: it may be helpful to focus one critique on the Map<String, Object> type of all responses, and another on the extensibility of the request format. If you’re stuck, imagine that you were processing one of those responses in Java.
